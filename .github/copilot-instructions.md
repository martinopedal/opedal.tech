# Copilot Instructions — opedal.tech

## Repository Purpose

Personal website for Martin Opedal (opedal.tech), hosted on GitHub Pages.
Built with **Astro** (static output) — Markdown-authored blog, component-based pages, zero client-side JS.

## Stack

- **Framework**: Astro (static output, `npm run build` → `dist/`)
- **Content**: Markdown blog posts in `src/content/blog/`
- **Styles**: Plain CSS in `src/styles/global.css` (warm earth — Architect Charcoal palette)
- **Hosted**: GitHub Pages, deployed via `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
- **Custom domain**: `opedal.tech` (CNAME file present)
- **Node version**: 22 (in CI via `actions/setup-node`)

## File structure

```
src/
  components/   — Astro components (Nav, Hero, About, Work, OpenSource, Speaking, Contact)
  content/
    blog/       — Markdown blog posts (.md files)
    config.ts   — Content collection schema
  layouts/      — BaseLayout.astro, BlogLayout.astro
  pages/        — index.astro, blog/index.astro, blog/[...slug].astro, rss.xml.js
  styles/       — global.css
public/         — Static assets (favicon.svg, og images)
```

## Adding a blog post

Create `src/content/blog/my-post.md` with frontmatter:
```md
---
title: "Post title"
description: "One-sentence description"
pubDate: 2025-06-01
tags: ["Azure", "Terraform"]
---
```

## Branch protection

- Signed commits NOT required (breaks Dependabot and GitHub API commits)
- 0 required reviewers (solo-maintained)
- `enforce_admins = true`, linear history, no force push
- Required status checks: `Analyze (actions)` (CodeQL) and `Build Astro site`

## CodeQL policy

- Scans GitHub Actions workflows only — `language: [actions]`
- Astro/TypeScript/CSS do not have a CodeQL extractor — this is expected

## SHA-pinning

- All GitHub Actions MUST use SHA-pinned versions, not tags
- Example: `actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6`

## GitHub Pages

- Source: GitHub Actions (workflow builds `dist/` and deploys)
- Custom domain configured in `CNAME` file and in repo Settings → Pages
- HTTPS enforced — never link to HTTP resources
- Deploy workflow: `.github/workflows/pages.yml`

## Design rules

- **Color scheme: warm earth dark** (Architect Charcoal — *not* GitHub blue)
  - `--color-bg: #14110f` (warm near-black base)
  - `--color-surface: #1c1814` (card resting)
  - `--color-elevated: #261f19` (card hover/active)
- **Accents (two-tone):**
  - `--color-accent: #d4a584` (peach — links, focus rings, primary accents)
  - `--color-accent-strong: #d97757` (terracotta — emphasis, button hover, metrics, /work arrows, skip-link)
  - `--color-accent-glow: rgba(217, 119, 87, .15)` (warm radial halos, button glows)
- **Shadows:** `--shadow-warm-sm` and `--shadow-warm-md` are terracotta-tinted (no neutral grey shadows).
- **Typography:**
  - Body, About prose, hero tagline, h2/h3 headings: system sans (`--font`)
  - JetBrains Mono (self-hosted, `/fonts/jetbrains-mono-variable.woff2`) for *all* technical labels: nav links, dates, language pills, repo names, footer, `.section-label`, `.cv-period`, `.cv-job h3`, hero `h1` name treatment
  - `--font-mono` stack: `'JetBrains Mono', 'SFMono-Regular', Consolas, ...`
- **Do not** reintroduce a GitHub-blue accent (`#2f81f7`) or GitHub-grey surfaces (`#0d1117`, `#161b22`). The warm palette is the brand commitment, locked in by `feat/design-stepup`.
- **Hero h1** is plain solid `--color-text` set in mono — no `linear-gradient` + `background-clip: text` tricks.
- **Card hover lift** (`.repo-row`, `.blog-card`, `.work-row`): 2px `translateY` + `--color-elevated` background + `--shadow-warm-md`. Property-scoped transitions, cancelled by `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- **Magnetic primary button** (`.btn-primary`): 1px lift + warm glow + 1px inset terracotta ring on hover, only inside `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`.
- **Section atmosphere alternation** on the homepage: `#hero` (radial halo), `#about` (bg), `#work` (surface), `#oss` (bg + inset accent line), `#speaking` (surface).
- Responsive: mobile-first, CSS-only hamburger nav on mobile (mobile dropdown is fully opaque `var(--color-surface)`).
- No external fonts, no CDN dependencies — fully self-contained for speed.
- All images must have `alt` attributes.
- Eyebrow (`.section-label`) text must add a category and never echo the H2 word-for-word.
- All new colors go through CSS variables — no magic hex literals scattered through the code.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected — transitions and hover lifts disabled for users who prefer it.

## Content rules

- Keep bio text accurate and current
- Repo stats (stars, forks) can drift — update quarterly or when significant
- No customer names or confidential engagement details
- No secrets in HTML source (no API keys, tokens, tracking pixels)

## Voice rules (apply to all narrative copy in `.astro`, `.md`, `.txt`)

These are the rules Martin enforces in production. They apply to every AI-generated and human-written change to bio, blog, About, Hero, llms.txt, humans.txt, and similar narrative content.

1. **Narrative copy stays general; dedicated cards stay specific.** In bio paragraphs use general descriptors. Yes: "I speak publicly on Terraform, GitHub Copilot, and infrastructure-as-code security." No: "I speak at the Nordic Infrastructure Conference on..." Reserve specific venue/event names for dedicated venue cards like `src/components/Speaking.astro` where naming the venue with a link is the whole point.
2. **Name ventures, drop status parentheticals.** Yes: "I co-founded Cervisiam and Krecher, plus Oculus bar." No: "Cervisiam (still active) and Krecher (ended), plus Oculus bar." If venture status genuinely matters somewhere, put it in a structured field, not narrative prose.
3. **State things once.** If two consecutive paragraphs make the same point with different words, merge them. Scan for paragraph-level theme duplication, not just sentence-level.
4. **No em dashes (`—` U+2014) or en dashes (`–` U+2013) anywhere.** Use commas, periods, semicolons, or " and " instead. CI does not catch these; reviewers must. Quick check: `Select-String -Pattern '[\u2014\u2013]' -Path src/**/*.astro,public/llms.txt,public/humans.txt -Encoding UTF8`.
5. **Banned AI-tell phrases.** Never use in any narrative copy on this site:
   - **Verbs:** leveraging, driving, unlocking, elevate, empower, accelerate, streamline, optimize
   - **Adjectives:** robust, comprehensive, cutting-edge, game-changer, future-proof, production-ready, enterprise-grade, AI-powered, seamless
   - **Filler openers:** "the reality is", "the truth is", "it's worth noting", "here's the thing", "the takeaway", "in today's landscape", "across industries"
   - **Excited openers:** "I'm excited to", "thrilled to", "humbled to", "grateful to announce", "now more than ever"
   - **Soft engagement closers:** "agree?", "thoughts?", "what are you seeing?"

   Replace with concrete operational language: name the tool, the constraint, the decision, or the number.

When generating copy, default to direct, concrete, specific. Name actual tools (ALZ Terraform module, AVM, Karpenter, AGC) and real constraints (subnet sizing, central firewall egress, SMI configuration). The full voice profile lives in the user-level writer skill at `~/.copilot/skills/linkedin-writer/SKILL.md` for sessions that have it; this section is the strict subset that always applies.

## Issue conventions

- Use labels `enhancement`, `bug`, `content`, `chore`, `documentation`, `dependencies`
- Issue titles: `feat:`, `fix:`, `content:`, `chore:` prefix convention
- The `copilot` label assigns an issue to the GitHub Copilot coding agent

## Security rules

- No secrets in code — use GitHub Secrets for any future workflow secrets
- SHA-pin all GitHub Actions
- No third-party analytics scripts that collect PII
- CSP enforced via `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` in BaseLayout — no inline scripts permitted
- No `define:vars` usage in Astro components (would require loosening CSP)
- **No `<style>` blocks in `.astro` components.** The CSP sets `style-src 'self'` with no `'unsafe-inline'`, so Astro's scoped `<style>` blocks (which become inline `<style>` tags in the head) are blocked at runtime. Add styles to `src/styles/global.css` instead.
- **No `<script>` blocks in `.astro` components** (same reason — `script-src 'none'`). The site is intentionally JS-free.
- **JSON-LD is fine**: `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks are CSP-exempt because they're parsed as data, not executable script. Used in `BaseLayout.astro` for the Person schema and in `BlogLayout.astro` for Article schema.
- **External link hygiene**: every `target="_blank"` link must have `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

## SEO baseline

- Every page passes `title` + `description` to `BaseLayout`. Descriptions should read as a real sentence, 120–160 chars, with the Microsoft-anchored title appearing somewhere on the homepage.
- Blog post pages use `BlogLayout`, which sets `ogType="article"` and emits an `Article` JSON-LD block alongside the sitewide `Person` schema.
- Sitemap is generated by `@astrojs/sitemap` (configured in `astro.config.mjs`); `public/robots.txt` declares it.

## GitHub-first principle

Validate changes in GitHub Actions, not locally. Push, trigger workflow, check logs, iterate.
